# Events Home Page

This repository contains the code for a simple events home page. The page allows users to search for events and displays a grid of events with relevant details. The layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file (`index.html`) includes a search box and a grid of events.
- Each event in the grid consists of an image, event details (header, date, seats available), and a "Book Now" button.

## CSS Styling

- The styling is defined in the `style.css` file.
- The layout is responsive, adjusting the number of columns in the event grid based on the screen size.
